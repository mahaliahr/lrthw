Cos honey that hour glass got me thinking
You ain't no friend of mine
We were moving so fast and you got me thinking
Why not keep chasing time?
I said ‘Honey I wanna find somewhere sacred,
away from your flashing lights’
Honey I was yours in the dark of the night

Come as you are
Come let me take a picture
Come as you are
